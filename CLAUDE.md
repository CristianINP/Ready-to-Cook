# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Frontend (React)
npm start          # Dev server on http://localhost:3000 (also accepts LAN connections via HOST=0.0.0.0 in .env)
npm run build      # Production build
npm test           # Run tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=<file>  # Run a single test file

# Backend proxy — local dev only (Vercel uses api/openai.js instead)
cd Api && npm start   # Express server on http://localhost:3001
```

Both servers must run simultaneously for local recipe generation — the React app calls `/api/openai`, the CRA dev proxy (`"proxy": "http://localhost:3001"` in `package.json`) forwards it to Express. On Vercel, `/api/openai` is handled by the serverless function `api/openai.js` — no Express needed.

## Architecture

**Ready-To-Cook** is a React SPA for food inventory management and AI recipe generation. Firebase handles auth and data; OpenAI GPT-4o-mini generates recipes via a proxy.

**Environments:**
- **Local dev**: Express server in `Api/` (port 3001) + CRA dev server (port 3000). The CRA proxy rewrites `/api/openai` → Express.
- **Production (Vercel)**: React static build served from `build/`; `api/openai.js` deployed as a Vercel Serverless Function at `/api/openai`. No Express.

`git config core.ignoreCase false` is set so that `Api/` (Express) and `api/` (Vercel function) are tracked as separate paths in git, even though Windows treats them as the same directory on disk.

### Routing

There is no React Router. Navigation is view-based state in [src/App.js](src/App.js): a `currentView` string controls which component renders. Components call `setCurrentView('...')` to navigate.

URL paths are kept in sync via `VIEW_PATHS` (a map of view name → path) and `window.history.pushState`. A `popstate` listener keeps `currentView` in sync when the user uses browser back/forward. Vercel's `vercel.json` rewrites all paths to `/index.html` so deep links work after a full reload.

| View | URL path |
|---|---|
| `login` | `/` |
| `register` | `/registro` |
| `recovery` | `/recuperar-cuenta` |
| `menu` | `/menu` |
| `inventory` | `/inventario` |
| `register-ingredient` | `/registrar-ingrediente` |
| `generate-recipe` | `/generar-receta-con-ia` |
| `recipe-results` | `/resultados` |
| `recipe-detail` | `/detalle-receta` |
| `pending-dishes` | `/platillos-pendientes` |
| `history` | `/historial` |

Recipe data (`generatedRecipes`, `selectedRecipe`, `currentRecipeIndex`) is lifted to App.js and passed as props — there is no Context or Redux.

**Auth navigation guards**: App.js holds three refs — `registrationInProgress`, `loginInProgress`, and `isInitialLoad` — that control `onAuthStateChanged` behavior. `isInitialLoad` is `true` only for the first auth callback; on silent session restore it navigates to the view matching the current URL path (or `menu` if the URL is a public view like `/`). Subsequent login/register flows navigate via their own modal callbacks instead. Login and Register each receive two callbacks: `onLoginComplete`/`onRegistrationComplete` (sets ref to `true` before showing the success modal) and `onLoginReset`/`onRegistrationReset` (sets ref back to `false` when the modal is dismissed without navigating, e.g. via the X button). Both must be called in `closeModal` to avoid the user being stuck authenticated but on the login screen.

### Firestore Data Model

Registration creates a root document at `users/{uid}` with fields `username`, `email`, `birthdate`, `createdAt`. If that write fails, the newly-created Auth user is deleted to avoid orphaned accounts.

Each authenticated user also has these subcollections under `users/{userId}/`:

| Subcollection | Fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ingredients` | `name`, `quantity`, `unit`, `purchaseDate`, `expirationDate`, `isFractioned`, `expirationDateType` | Inventory items. `isFractioned` = quantity < 1. `expirationDateType`: `"calculada"` (system-computed) or `"manual"` (user-entered); old docs without the field are treated as `"calculada"`. Auto-recalculation is skipped when `"manual"`. |
| `pendingDishes` | `name`, `ingredients[]`, `instructions[]`, `expirationDate` | Saved recipes to finish later. Shelf life set by GPT-4o-mini. |
| `personalFoods` | `name`, `completo`, `fraccionado`, `category` | User's custom food DB entries matching global `foodDatabase` schema. |
| `history` | `name`, `ingredients[]`, `instructions[]`, `prepTime`, `servings`, `completedAt`, `favorite` | Completed recipes. Written by `RecipeDetail.js` when a recipe is marked done. |

### Services

- [src/services/firebase.js](src/services/firebase.js) — Initializes Firebase; exports `auth` and `db` (Firestore). All components import directly from here.
- [src/services/openaiService.js](src/services/openaiService.js) — `generateRecipe()` builds the OpenAI prompt, enforces a `json_schema` response format (structured output), sanitizes the result (handles typographic quotes, invalid JSON chars), and applies retry logic with exponential backoff. Temperature is 0.5 for new recipes and 0.7 for regeneration. Incompatible category+ingredient combinations (e.g. Vegetariana with meat) throw an error with `isAIError: true` and `isCompatibilityError: true` — callers should surface a user-friendly message rather than retrying. `calculateDishShelfLife()` calls GPT-4o-mini to get refrigeration days for a pending dish (falls back to 3 days on error).
- [src/services/foodDatabase.js](src/services/foodDatabase.js) — Hardcoded shelf-life database (~90 foods, both `completo` and `fraccionado` days). Key exports: `getFoodSuggestionsComplete(query, userId)` for autocomplete (merges global + personal DB); `calculateExpirationDateComplete(name, unit, purchaseDate, userId)` computes expiry; `addToPersonalFoodDatabase(userId, name, shelfLifeDays)` saves a new custom food; `searchFood(name)` returns the best global DB match (used internally when recalculating expiry after fractioning).

### Components

- [src/components/Auth/Login.js](src/components/Auth/Login.js) — Email/password login via Firebase `signInWithEmailAndPassword`. Calls `onLoginComplete` before showing the `welcome` modal; calls `onLoginReset` when the modal is dismissed without navigating (X button).
- [src/components/Auth/Register.js](src/components/Auth/Register.js) — Creates Firebase Auth user, sets `displayName`, then writes the root `users/{uid}` Firestore doc. Rolls back the Auth user if Firestore write fails. Password rules: ≥8 chars, ≥1 uppercase, ≥1 digit. Uses `registrationCompleted` ref to guard `closeModal` (see Auth navigation guards above).
- [src/components/Auth/Recovery.js](src/components/Auth/Recovery.js) — Sends password reset email via `sendPasswordResetEmail`. No modal; uses inline success/error state. No auth guard callbacks needed.
- [src/components/Ingredients/RegisterIngredient.js](src/components/Ingredients/RegisterIngredient.js) — Form to add one ingredient. Calls `getFoodSuggestionsComplete` on name input (≥2 chars) for autocomplete, then `calculateExpirationDateComplete` to compute expiry. Default unit is `Piezas`. When `manualExpiration` is toggled, expiry is stored as `"manual"` type and auto-recalculation is skipped. Dates normalized to 12:00 PM local via `normalizeDateForFirestore`.
- [src/components/Main/MainMenu.js](src/components/Main/MainMenu.js) — Central dashboard after login. Stateless; receives `setCurrentView` and `onLogout`. Renders five navigation cards: `generate-recipe`, `register-ingredient`, `inventory`, `pending-dishes`, `history`.
- [src/components/Dishes/History.js](src/components/Dishes/History.js) — Lists all completed recipes from `users/{userId}/history`, sorted newest-first by `completedAt`. Supports expandable accordion cards, favorite toggle (updates Firestore `favorite` field), and delete with confirmation modal.
- [src/components/Dishes/PendingDishes.js](src/components/Dishes/PendingDishes.js) — Lists saved-for-later recipes from `users/{userId}/pendingDishes`. Allows navigating to `recipe-detail` to cook a pending dish, or deleting it.
- [src/components/Recipes/RecipeResults.js](src/components/Recipes/RecipeResults.js) — Renders the generated recipe card with carousel navigation (`currentIndex`/`setCurrentIndex`). Handles the "regenerate" flow by calling `generateRecipe()` again with `regenerate: true` and the list of already-used recipe names (tracked in local `usedRecipeNames` state, not App.js). Reads generation params from `sessionStorage.lastRecipeParams` (written by `GenerateRecipe.js`) — if absent, the regenerate button redirects back to `generate-recipe` instead. Navigates to `recipe-detail` by setting `selectedRecipe` in App.js state.
- [src/components/Ingredients/Inventory.js](src/components/Ingredients/Inventory.js) — Polls Firestore every 60 seconds to refresh expiry status live.
- [src/components/Recipes/GenerateRecipe.js](src/components/Recipes/GenerateRecipe.js) — Loads non-expired ingredients and pending dishes from Firestore. User selects ingredients/dishes, up to 3 categories, meal time (`Desayuno`/`Comida`/`Cena`/`Merienda`), and servings (1–8). Priority ingredients (≤3 days) are highlighted. On submit, calls `generateRecipe()`, saves params to `sessionStorage.lastRecipeParams`, then navigates to `recipe-results`.
- [src/components/Recipes/RecipeDetail.js](src/components/Recipes/RecipeDetail.js) — Shows a single recipe. User can toggle whether each ingredient was used and adjust the quantity consumed. Two actions: **Complete** (batch: decrement/delete inventory + write history entry) and **Save as pending** (GPT shelf-life call + batch: write pendingDishes + decrement inventory). `savingAction` state blocks double-submission. Pending dish cleanup (deleting `usedPendingDishIds`) runs outside the batch.

### Utils

- [src/utils/recipeHelpers.js](src/utils/recipeHelpers.js) — `normalizeOpenAIResponse()` validates and normalizes recipe JSON shape; `retryOperation()` wraps async calls with exponential backoff; `cleanText()` coerces `null`/`"null"` to empty strings; `formatQuantity()` / `parseSafeQuantity()` / `isNumeric()` handle safe numeric display (avoid NaN in UI).
- [src/utils/dateCalculations.js](src/utils/dateCalculations.js) — `isPriority()` (≤3 days), `isExpired()`, `getDaysRemaining()`, `formatDate()`, `toISODateString()`, `getTodayISO()`. All functions use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with `timeZone: 'America/Mexico_City'` to avoid UTC-offset day-shift bugs. Never compare raw `new Date(isoString)` against `setHours(0,0,0,0)` — always go through the helpers in this file.
- [src/utils/Modal.js](src/utils/Modal.js) — Shared modal component used by all views; supports `type`: `confirm`, `success`, `error`, `welcome`.

### Key Data Flows

**Adding an ingredient**: `RegisterIngredient.js` → `getFoodSuggestionsComplete()` for autocomplete → `calculateExpirationDateComplete()` for expiry → saves to Firestore `users/{userId}/ingredients`. Dates are normalized to 12:00 PM local time via `normalizeDateForFirestore()` (splits the `YYYY-MM-DD` string and calls `new Date(y, m-1, d, 12)` — never `new Date(dateOnlyString)` which would parse as UTC midnight). `calculateExpirationDateComplete` applies the same local-noon construction before adding shelf-life days.

**Generating a recipe**: `GenerateRecipe.js` → `openaiService.generateRecipe()` → proxy at `Api/index.js` → OpenAI (structured `json_schema` output) → JSON sanitized/validated → results passed via App.js state to `RecipeResults.js`. Before navigating, `GenerateRecipe.js` also: (1) saves the generation params to `sessionStorage.lastRecipeParams` for use by the regenerate button, and (2) appends `usedPendingDishIds` and `usedPendingDishNames` to each recipe object so `RecipeDetail.js` can auto-delete consumed pending dishes. Available categories: `Snack`, `Postre`, `Saludable`, `Rápida`, `Internacional`, `Mexicana`, `Vegana`, `Vegetariana`, `Alta en proteína`.

**Completing a recipe** (`RecipeDetail.js`): uses `writeBatch` to atomically decrement/delete ingredient quantities and write the history entry in one commit. If a `Piezas` ingredient transitions from whole to fractional (`isFractioned = true`), recalculates expiry using the `fraccionado` days from `foodDatabase`. Pending dish cleanup runs outside the batch (best-effort, individual try/catch). `RecipeDetail` has a `savingAction` state (`'complete' | 'pending' | null`) that blocks double-submission while a batch is in flight.

**Saving as pending dish**: `RecipeDetail.js` → calls `calculateDishShelfLife(ingredients)` via GPT-4o-mini → uses `writeBatch` to atomically write the `pendingDishes` entry and decrement ingredient quantities in one commit.

**Personal food DB**: Each user has a Firestore subcollection for custom foods with their own shelf-life data. `getFoodSuggestionsComplete()` merges global and personal results.

### Proxy Error Strategy

`Api/index.js` passes OpenAI's actual HTTP status through (`res.status(response.status)`). This lets the frontend's `retryOperation()` distinguish 429 (rate-limit, retry), 5xx (server error, retry), and 400/other (don't retry). Network-level failures from the proxy return 503.

### Styling

Tailwind CSS with a custom food theme in [tailwind.config.js](tailwind.config.js). Custom color families: `food` (orange/brown), `fresh` (green), `tomato` (red), `cream` (warm neutrals). `font-cooking` maps to Georgia serif. Custom animations: `bounce-food`, `pulse-fresh`, `wiggle`. Icons are from `lucide-react`.

Component-level utility classes are defined with `@layer` in [src/index.css](src/index.css):

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `card-food` | White card with depth shadow |
| `btn-food` | Primary CTA button (orange outline → filled on hover) |
| `input-food` | Styled text input with orange focus ring |
| `table-food` | Table with warm header and hover rows |
| `badge-fresh` | Green pill for non-expiring items |
| `badge-priority` | Red pill for near-expiry items |
| `badge-expired` | Dark red pill for expired items |
| `fresh-glow` | Green box-shadow glow |
| `warning-glow` | Red box-shadow glow for near-expiry |
| `expired-glow` | Darker red glow for expired items |
| `bg-food-pattern` | SVG star crosshatch background |
| `bg-kitchen` | Gradient kitchen background |
| `border-cooking` | Orange dashed double-border effect |

### Known Rendering Trap

**`sanitizeJsonString` in `openaiService.js` contains a regex with embedded binary control characters.** When any text editor or tool renders line 39, it looks like `/[ --]/g` — which appears to strip spaces and quotes from JSON. It is **not** broken. The file stores actual NUL (`\x00`), US (`\x1F`), DEL (`\x7F`), and APC (`\x9F`) bytes inside the character class; the correct pattern is `/[\x00-\x1F\x7F-\x9F]/g`, which strips only control characters. Do not "fix" this line — editing it with a normal text tool will corrupt the embedded bytes and actually break the regex.

### Critical Invariants

**Firestore multi-document writes must use `writeBatch`** — never chain sequential `addDoc`/`updateDoc`/`deleteDoc` calls. If one step fails, partial writes corrupt user data. To get an auto-generated ID inside a batch (where `addDoc` isn't available), use `doc(collection(db, path))` then `batch.set(ref, data)`.

**Validate `parseSafeQuantity` before arithmetic** — the function returns `{ type: 'number', number: N }` or `{ type: 'text', text: S }`. Always guard `if (parsedQty.type !== 'number' || parsedQty.number <= 0)` and show an error modal before attempting any quantity math. Skipping this guard produces a silent no-op (inventory unchanged but no error shown).

**Register's `closeModal` must not reset the auth guard after successful registration** — `registrationCompleted` ref tracks whether the success modal fired; `closeModal` only calls `onRegistrationReset` when that ref is `false`.

**`closeModal` must always use a functional updater** — write `setModalConfig(prev => ({ ...prev, isOpen: false }))`, never `setModalConfig({ ...modalConfig, isOpen: false })`. The non-functional form captures a stale closure; if `showModal` is called synchronously before `closeModal` fires (both within the same React batch), the spread of the stale value overwrites the newly-opened modal, silently suppressing it.

**Validate inputs before opening a confirm modal, not inside `onConfirm`** — `Modal.js` closes confirm-type modals first (synchronously) and then `await`s `onConfirm`. Any `showModal` call made synchronously inside `onConfirm` before the first `await` races against the auto-close and may be suppressed. Move validation to the caller before `showModal('confirm', ...)` is invoked.

**Guard Firestore date fields against Timestamp objects** — when reading `purchaseDate` or `expirationDate` from a Firestore document snapshot, use `field?.toDate ? field.toDate() : new Date(field)`. Passing a Firestore Timestamp directly to `new Date()` produces `Invalid Date`, which silently writes `"Invalid Date"` strings into Firestore inside a batch commit.
